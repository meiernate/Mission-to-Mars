# Mission-to-Mars


## Overview of Project
The client is an ambitious aerospace company thatâ€™s doing research about resource extraction from nearby planets.

The request is to scrape, organize, analyze, and visualize the data. The focus is on gathering information about the climate of Mars.

## Results
The data was analyzed to answer the following questions:

1.  How many months exist on Mars?
    *  Mars has 12 months.

2.  How many Martian (and not Earth) days worth of data exist in the scraped dataset?
    *  There is 1867 Martian Days worth of data.

3.  What are the coldest and the warmest months on Mars?
    * The coldest was month number 3, with an average of -83 celsius. 
    * The warmest was month number 8, with an average of -68 celsius.
